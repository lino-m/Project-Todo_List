# Project-Todo_List

This is a simple project to help me practice JavaScript and create a minimalistic Todo List

In this app, the user can:
1. Create a new todo
2. Mark the todo as done
3. Filter todos by the categories: completed, uncompleted, and all
4. Delete todos

Additional Functionality
1. The app stores todos to local stroge upon their creation
2. Even if returned to or after being refreshed the list will persist
3. Deleted todos are deleted from local storage

Open points // Possible Improvements:
1. Style is basic (but not too bad)
2. The state of the todo, i.e. completed or not is not saved in local storge => not recreated after the page is refreshed
3. Task could be dragged and dropped by the user -> as method of prioritization
